        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Not a particularly common meal in my house, but a good choice 
        when I'd like to make some gravy, which is the thing that really 
        makes this dish something special.</p>
        
        <p>This meal is a great way to use up any left over raw burger 
        patties or any extra ground beef you might have, that you might 
        not otherwise know what to do with.</p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>More than a third pound of beef, or at least one burger patty</li>
            <li>A couple tablespoons of flour</li>
            <li>A box of beef stock 
                Be prepared to use more that a two cups per pound</li>
            <li>1-2 onions</li>
            <li>not more than carton of mushrooms</li>
            <li>onion powder</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat pan 
                You want the pan to be hot in order to get a good seer.</li>
            <li>While the pan preheats, form and season your meat 
                If you have preformed burger patties, you may leave all 
                your seasonings on the outside of patty. However, if you 
                have a block or chub of ground beef, feel free to mix 
                your seasonings into the meat. If you are forming your 
                meat, simply form it the same way you would a burger. If 
                you want to, you may pinch and prod the patty to be more 
                elongated and steak like.</li>
            <li>Seer your meat 
                Lightly oil the pan and place in your meat. You simply want  
                to get a sear on outside of your patties. We'll finish  
                cooking the meat at a later step.</li>
            <li>Cut onions and mushrooms 
                Juliene your onions, and slice your mushrooms</li>
            <li>Remove meat, turn down heat and place in veggies 
                Once the meat is removed, place in a spot of oil to help keep 
                your vegetables from sticking. Don't worry about any fond in 
                the bottom of the pan. Onions are quite excelent at deglazing. 
                Cook your mushrooms and onions until the onions have taken a 
                slightly golden color. They won't be fully caramalized at this 
                point, but they'll continue cookig while you make the gravy.</li>
            <li>Begin making the gravy 
                Making the gravy is quite simple. Simply pour a quarter cup 
                of beef stock at a time and let it reduce by half. There's 
                no starch in any of the ingredients, so the gravy will not 
                get thick on it's own. You can add a heavy pinch of flour at 
                any time to make the sauce thicker. The more stock you put 
                into the gravy, the stronger it will taste. If you end up 
                with more gravy than you'd like to use, you can simply 
                reduce what you have until the volume matches what you 
                desire.</li>
            <li>Put patties back into the gravy 
                Cook until you've reached desired doneness. For a half pound 
                burger, 8 minutes per side should be sufficent.</li>
            <li>Serve 
                Plate the patty first, and pour the gravy over the top 
                I would recommend serving with a side of potato.</li>
        </ol>
