        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Not a particularly common meal in my house, but a good choice<br>
        when I'd like to make some gravy, which is the thing that really<br>
        makes this dish something special.</p>
        
        <p>This meal is a great way to use up any left over raw burger<br>
        patties or any extra ground beef you might have, that you might<br>
        not otherwise know what to do with.</p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>More than a third pound of beef, or at least one burger patty</li>
            <li>A couple tablespoons of flour</li>
            <li>A box of beef stock<br>
                Be prepared to use more that a two cups per pound</li>
            <li>1-2 onions</li>
            <li>not more than carton of mushrooms</li>
            <li>onion powder</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat pan<br>
                You want the pan to be hot in order to get a good seer.</li>
            <li>While the pan preheats, form and season your meat<br>
                If you have preformed burger patties, you may leave all<br>
                your seasonings on the outside of patty. However, if you<br>
                have a block or chub of ground beef, feel free to mix<br>
                your seasonings into the meat. If you are forming your<br>
                meat, simply form it the same way you would a burger. If<br>
                you want to, you may pinch and prod the patty to be more<br>
                elongated and steak like.</li>
            <li>Seer your meat<br>
                Lightly oil the pan and place in your meat. You simply want <br>
                to get a sear on outside of your patties. We'll finish <br>
                cooking the meat at a later step.</li>
            <li>Cut onions and mushrooms<br>
                Juliene your onions, and slice your mushrooms</li>
            <li>Remove meat, turn down heat and place in veggies<br>
                Once the meat is removed, place in a spot of oil to help keep<br>
                your vegetables from sticking. Don't worry about any fond in<br>
                the bottom of the pan. Onions are quite excelent at deglazing.<br>
                Cook your mushrooms and onions until the onions have taken a<br>
                slightly golden color. They won't be fully caramalized at this<br>
                point, but they'll continue cookig while you make the gravy.</li>
            <li>Begin making the gravy<br>
                Making the gravy is quite simple. Simply pour a quarter cup<br>
                of beef stock at a time and let it reduce by half. There's<br>
                no starch in any of the ingredients, so the gravy will not<br>
                get thick on it's own. You can add a heavy pinch of flour at<br>
                any time to make the sauce thicker. The more stock you put<br>
                into the gravy, the stronger it will taste. If you end up<br>
                with more gravy than you'd like to use, you can simply<br>
                reduce what you have until the volume matches what you<br>
                desire.</li>
            <li>Put patties back into the gravy<br>
                Cook until you've reached desired doneness. For a half pound<br>
                burger, 8 minutes per side should be sufficent.</li>
            <li>Serve<br>
                Plate the patty first, and pour the gravy over the top<br>
                I would recommend serving with a side of potato.</li>
        </ol>
