    <h1>Chili</h1>
    <p>A warm bowl of comfort for cool nights. A particular favorite of mine, since it&rsquo;s<br>
        so easy, and if you're in a hurry, it&rsquo;s quite quick to make. Although, if you have <br>
        the time it does benefit from a long stew.</p>
        
    <p>You will have left overs from this recipe, but that's totally fine, because the<br>
        rumors that chili is better the second day is absolutely true. Reheating is as<br>
        easy as simply popping the amount you'd like to eat in the microwave for 1-2<br>
        minutes at a time, stirring before putting the chili back in for more time.</p>
