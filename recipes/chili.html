    <h3>Descrpition</h3>
    <p>A warm bowl of comfort for cool nights. A particular favorite of mine, since it&rsquo;s<br>
        so easy, and if you're in a hurry, it&rsquo;s quite quick to make. Although, if you have <br>
        the time it does benefit from a long stew.</p>
        
    <p>You will have left overs from this recipe, but that's totally fine, because the<br>
        rumors that chili is better the second day is absolutely true. Reheating is as<br>
        easy as simply popping the amount you'd like to eat in the microwave for 1-2<br>
        minutes at a time, stirring before putting the chili back in for more time.</p>
    
    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1-2 lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>1 can Corn</li>
        <li>2 cans Beans</li>
        <li>1-2 onions</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1-4 tbl chocolate chips</li>
        <li>chili spice</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>cayenne</li>
        <li>chipotle powder, or smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking the onions until translucent</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef in a pan <br>
            Do not remove the onions. Let them continue cooking with meat<br>
            You may toss the fat that renders out, or you may leave it in the chili</li>
        <li>put your meat and onions into a large pot, and combine with canned ingredients<br>
            There is no need to drain the cans prior to putting them in the pot, however is<br>
            you desire a thicker chili it okay to do so. I would recomend however, to at<br>
            least save the bean water, as it has a ton of flavor, and excess liquid can<br>
            always be reduced.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture come to a simmer.<br>
            The higher your heat, the more frequently you'll need to stir the pot. Don't set<br>
            the temperature too low however, as once the next step is complete, the chili <br>
            will need significantly less attention.</li>
        <li>Add spices to taste<br>
            Because this is such a large quantity of food, you'll need more spice than you<br>
            may be used to using. Adding salt can really wake up the flavors of the other <br>
            spices. Cayenne will add heat to the meal. Chipotle powder will add smokiness <br>
            and heat. Paprika will just added a little smokiness on it's own. Chili powerder<br>
            is the main flavor addition in the spice mix</li>
        <li>Optionally add chocolate<br>
            A little bit of chocolate can bring that second day flavor fresh from the pot.<br>
            If you add too much and mellow the flavor more than you'd you like, you can<br>
            undo the damage by simply adding salt.</li>
        <li>Simmer the pot to let the flavors mellow together<br>
            From this point, the chili is done when you say it is. Don't forget to stir<br>
            occasionally. If the bottom burns, there is no fixing the taste that it will<br>
            impart onto the rest of the pot.</li>
    </ol>
