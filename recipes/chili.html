    <h3>Descrpition</h3>
    <p>A warm bowl of comfort for cool nights. A particular favorite of mine, since it&rsquo;s 
        so easy, and if you're in a hurry, it&rsquo;s quite quick to make. Although, if you have  
        the time it does benefit from a long stew.</p>
        
    <p>You will have left overs from this recipe, but that's totally fine, because the 
        rumors that chili is better the second day is absolutely true. Reheating is as 
        easy as simply popping the amount you'd like to eat in the microwave for 1-2 
        minutes at a time, stirring before putting the chili back in for more time.</p>
    
    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1-2 lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>1 can Corn</li>
        <li>2 cans Beans</li>
        <li>1-2 onions</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1-4 tbl chocolate chips</li>
        <li>chili spice</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>cayenne</li>
        <li>chipotle powder, or smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking the onions until translucent</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef in a pan 
            <div class="explanation">Do not remove the onions. Let them continue cooking with meat 
            You may toss the fat that renders out, or you may leave it in the chili</div></li>
        <li>put your meat and onions into a large pot, and combine with canned ingredients 
            <div class="explanation">There is no need to drain the cans prior to putting them in the pot, however is 
            you desire a thicker chili it okay to do so. I would recomend however, to at 
            least save the bean water, as it has a ton of flavor, and excess liquid can 
            always be reduced.</div></li>
        <li>Let the mixture come to a simmer. 
            <div class="explanation">The higher your heat, the more frequently you'll need to stir the pot. Don't set 
            the temperature too low however, as once the next step is complete, the chili 
            will need significantly less attention.</div></li>
        <li>Add spices to taste 
            <div class="explanation">Because this is such a large quantity of food, you'll need more spice than you 
            may be used to using. Adding salt can really wake up the flavors of the other 
            spices. Cayenne will add heat to the meal. Chipotle powder will add smokiness 
            and heat. Paprika will just added a little smokiness on it's own. Chili powerder 
            is the main flavor addition in the spice mix</div></li>
        <li>Optionally add chocolate 
            <div class="explanation">A little bit of chocolate can bring that second day flavor fresh from the pot. 
            If you add too much and mellow the flavor more than you'd you like, you can 
            undo the damage by simply adding salt.</div></li>
        <li>Simmer the pot to let the flavors mellow together 
            <div class="explanation">From this point, the chili is done when you say it is. Don't forget to stir 
            occasionally. If the bottom burns, there is no fixing the taste that it will 
            impart onto the rest of the pot.</div></li>
    </ol>
