        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fajitas are a food from my childhood. I don't know 
        that my idea of fajitas closely matches anyone elses. 
        in this case, what I mean a mixture of chicken and 
        veggies put in a tortilla with cheese and salsa.</p>

        <p>Because many people don't seem to know how to make 
        a tortilla wrap, I'm including a tutorial here. 
        First, collect the fillings into a line in the center  
        of the tortilla. Leave space at one end of the tortilla. 
        If you want to do a burrito wrap, leave space at both 
        ends. Fold the end of the tortilla that you left space 
        on. It should cover a portion, usually less than half, 
        of the fillings. Turn the tortilla 90 degrees, fold up 
        the end cloest to you, so that the fillings sit right in 
        the crease. From there, you can simply roll the tortilla 
        to take up the excess.</p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pack of 10 inch tortillas</li>
            <li>2 medium chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 red pepper</li>
            <li>1 green pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 pack of fajita seasoning (or <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-fajita-seasoning/#wprm-recipe-container-110691"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener">make your own</a>)</li>
            <li>shredded cheese</li>
            <li>salsa</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>start by julienning your onions and peppers 
                You can dice them instead, but I prefere my peppers to 
                be long in my fajitas.</li>
            <li>In a 12 inch skillet, start heating some oil 
                a ten inch may also work, but the more area in the pan, 
                the more likely you'll be able to properly brown your  
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Once hot, throw in your veggies 
                You're not aiming to cook the peppers and onions to 
                completion, they'll finish cooking when you put the  
                chicken in.</li>
            <li>Cut your chicken breasts into narrow strips 
                If you desire a strip with a slightly more square 
                cross section, I'd recomend butterflying the breast.</li>
            <li>Put your chicken in the pan with your vegetables. 
                Make a space in the center of the pan, adding a little 
                oil, so that the chicken can make good contact with the 
                pan. Make sure the pan is good and hot. You have a  
                limited time to get any browning on the chicken before the 
                water squeezes out and prevents the pan from getting hotter 
                than 200 degrees.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until chicken is cooked through 
                the pieces will probably be too thin to put a thermometer on, 
                but if you cut open your largest piece, and there's no pink 
                left, you can trust that your other pieces are also cooked 
                through</li>
            <li>Add in the seasoning 
                If any seasoning gets stuck to the bottom of the pan, you can 
                deglaze with 1/4 cup of water. This will also help the seasoning 
                to mix more evenly into your fajita mixture. No thickeners are 
                needed</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve 
                Take the pan off the heat, and scoop some filling into your 
                tortilla. You can heat the tortilla for 15 seconds in the 
                microwave or 30 seconds in a hot pan to make it more pliable. 
                Add cheese and salsa to taste and wrap.</li>
        </ol>
