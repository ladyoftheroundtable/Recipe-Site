        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fajitas are a food from my childhood. I don't know<br>
        that my idea of fajitas closely matches anyone elses.<br>
        in this case, what I mean a mixture of chicken and<br>
        veggies put in a tortilla with cheese and salsa.</p>

        <p>Because many people don't seem to know how to make<br>
        a tortilla wrap, I'm including a tutorial here.<br>
        First, collect the fillings into a line in the center <br>
        of the tortilla. Leave space at one end of the tortilla.<br>
        If you want to do a burrito wrap, leave space at both<br>
        ends. Fold the end of the tortilla that you left space<br>
        on. It should cover a portion, usually less than half,<br>
        of the fillings. Turn the tortilla 90 degrees, fold up<br>
        the end cloest to you, so that the fillings sit right in<br>
        the crease. From there, you can simply roll the tortilla<br>
        to take up the excess.</p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pack of 10 inch tortillas</li>
            <li>2 medium chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 red pepper</li>
            <li>1 green pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 pack of fajita seasoning (or <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-fajita-seasoning/#wprm-recipe-container-110691"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noopener">make your own</a>)</li>
            <li>shredded cheese</li>
            <li>salsa</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>start by julienning your onions and peppers<br>
                You can dice them instead, but I prefere my peppers to<br>
                be long in my fajitas.</li>
            <li>In a 12 inch skillet, start heating some oil<br>
                a ten inch may also work, but the more area in the pan,<br>
                the more likely you'll be able to properly brown your <br>
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Once hot, throw in your veggies<br>
                You're not aiming to cook the peppers and onions to<br>
                completion, they'll finish cooking when you put the <br>
                chicken in.</li>
            <li>Cut your chicken breasts into narrow strips<br>
                If you desire a strip with a slightly more square<br>
                cross section, I'd recomend butterflying the breast.</li>
            <li>Put your chicken in the pan with your vegetables.<br>
                Make a space in the center of the pan, adding a little<br>
                oil, so that the chicken can make good contact with the<br>
                pan. Make sure the pan is good and hot. You have a <br>
                limited time to get any browning on the chicken before the<br>
                water squeezes out and prevents the pan from getting hotter<br>
                than 200 degrees.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until chicken is cooked through<br>
                the pieces will probably be too thin to put a thermometer on,<br>
                but if you cut open your largest piece, and there's no pink<br>
                left, you can trust that your other pieces are also cooked<br>
                through</li>
            <li>Add in the seasoning<br>
                If any seasoning gets stuck to the bottom of the pan, you can<br>
                deglaze with 1/4 cup of water. This will also help the seasoning<br>
                to mix more evenly into your fajita mixture. No thickeners are<br>
                needed</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve<br>
                Take the pan off the heat, and scoop some filling into your<br>
                tortilla. You can heat the tortilla for 15 seconds in the<br>
                microwave or 30 seconds in a hot pan to make it more pliable.<br>
                Add cheese and salsa to taste and wrap.</li>
        </ol>
